### Solution Overview

The provided Python code solves both parts of the Advent of Code problem by processing a corrupted memory input containing `mul(x, y)`, `do()`, and `don't()` instructions.

#### Part 1:
- The code reads the entire input file and scans it for valid `mul(x, y)` instructions.
- It uses a regex to match the pattern `mul(x, y)` and calculates the product of `x` and `y` for each valid match.
- All corrupted or non-matching parts (such as invalid characters or malformed `mul` instructions) are ignored.
- The sum of all valid multiplication results is calculated and printed.

#### Part 2:
- In addition to `mul(x, y)`, the code also handles two new instructions: `do()` and `don't()`.
- The `do()` instruction enables future `mul` instructions, while the `don't()` instruction disables them. The most recent `do()` or `don't()` instruction applies.
- The code tracks whether `mul` instructions should be processed using a flag (`looking_for_mul`).
- When encountering `do()` or `don't()`, the code updates the flag accordingly, enabling or disabling subsequent `mul` instructions.
- Only the `mul` instructions that are enabled by the most recent `do()` instruction are processed, and their products are summed.
- The final total sum of valid `mul` results, considering the state of the `do()` and `don't()` instructions, is printed.

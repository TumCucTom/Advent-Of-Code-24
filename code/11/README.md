# Solution Explanation: Plutonian Pebbles Problem

This solution tackles the "Plutonian Pebbles" problem, where stones with engraved numbers undergo transformations based on specific rules when they "blink". The goal is to simulate these transformations and determine the number of stones after a specified number of blinks.

## Code Breakdown

### 1. **`transform_stones_count(stones_count)`**:
This function processes the stones and their counts based on three transformation rules:
- **Rule 1**: If the stone is `0`, it becomes `1`. The count of `1`s is incremented.
- **Rule 2**: If the stone has an even number of digits, it splits into two parts. The stone is divided into two parts (left and right halves), and both parts are added to the count.
- **Rule 3**: If none of the above rules apply, the stone is replaced by a new stone, which is the original stone multiplied by `2024`. The count of the new stone is updated accordingly.

### 2. **`simulate_blinks(initial_stones, num_blinks)`**:
This function simulates the blinks. Initially, a count of the stones is prepared in the form of a dictionary (`stones_count`). For each blink, the transformation rules are applied to the stones, and the dictionary is updated accordingly.
- After the specified number of blinks, the total number of stones is the sum of the counts in `stones_count`.
- The result is copied to the clipboard using the `pyperclip` library.

### 3. **`read_input(file_path)`**:
This function reads the initial stone arrangement from a file. The numbers in the file are split by spaces and converted into a list of integers.

### 4. **Main Functionality**:
- The input is read from the file `../data/11.txt`.
- The number of blinks is set to 75, as specified in the problem.
- The function `simulate_blinks` is called to calculate the number of stones after 75 blinks.
- The result is printed and copied to the clipboard.

### Problem Model

- **Part One**:
    - You are asked to simulate the stone transformations for 25 blinks and determine the number of stones after the transformations.
    - The solution uses the transformation rules to track how the stones change and counts them efficiently using dictionaries.

- **Part Two**:
    - In the second part, you need to simulate the transformations for 75 blinks, following the same transformation rules but for a larger number of blinks.
    - The result of the 75-blink simulation is a much larger number of stones.

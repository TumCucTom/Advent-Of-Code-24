### Solution Overview

The code solves the Advent of Code puzzle by verifying if the page numbers in each update follow the specified ordering rules, and then computing the sum of middle page numbers for both correctly and incorrectly ordered updates.

1. **Input Parsing:**
    - The input consists of two sections: one with page ordering rules (e.g., `47|53`), and another with the page numbers for each update. These are read and processed separately.

2. **Rule and Update Handling:**
    - The ordering rules are stored as pairs, where `x|y` means that page `x` must appear before page `y` in the update.
    - Each update is a list of page numbers that needs to be validated against these rules.

3. **Validation Functions:**
    - `satisfies_condition` checks if an update's page numbers adhere to the given rules, ensuring that pages appear in the correct order.
    - `rearrange_array` is used to rearrange incorrectly ordered updates into a valid sequence by sorting the pages according to the rules.

4. **Middle Page Calculation:**
    - For each update that satisfies the order conditions, the middle page number is identified and added to a total sum.
    - The code separately handles both correctly and incorrectly ordered updates and calculates the middle values accordingly.

5. **Final Output:**
    - The sum of the middle page numbers for correctly ordered updates is printed.
    - The sum of the middle page numbers for the corrected updates is also computed and output.

This solution efficiently handles the task of verifying and rearranging page updates based on the ordering rules, and calculates the required sums for the middle page numbers.

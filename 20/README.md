# Solution Explanation

This solution involves navigating a grid-based map and finding the fastest way to travel from a start position ('S') to an end position ('E'). The program also explores the possibility of "cheating," where a program can disable wall collisions for a limited time, allowing it to pass through walls and save time. The goal is to find all possible valid cheat paths that save at least a certain amount of time (100 picoseconds in part two).

## Key Elements of the Code:

### 1. **Grid Setup and Parsing:**
- The map is read from a text file and split into rows and columns.
- The start ('S') and end ('E') positions are identified in the grid.

### 2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
- BFS is used to calculate the shortest distance from the end ('E') to all other positions on the grid. This is stored in a dictionary `distances` to facilitate quick lookups when processing cheat paths.

### 3. **Cheat Path Calculation:**
- The `find_possible_cheat_positions` function finds all possible cheat paths. A cheat involves traversing through walls for up to a specified amount of time (2 or 20 picoseconds).
- For each possible starting point of a cheat, the program explores all possible paths, including those where the program temporarily passes through walls.
- The `queue` stores the state of the search, including the current position, whether the cheat has started or ended, and the remaining cheat time.
- The program ensures that no position is visited more than once for the same cheat state to avoid redundant calculations.

### 4. **Result Calculation:**
- The solution calculates the number of distinct cheat paths for different cheat durations (2 and 20 picoseconds).
- These results are stored and printed for both part one and part two of the puzzle.

### 5. **Final Output:**
- The total number of valid cheat paths that save at least 100 picoseconds is printed and copied to the clipboard using the `pyperclip` module.

## Function Breakdown:

- **`extract_integers(s)`**: Extracts integers from a string using regular expressions.
- **`print_and_copy_to_clipboard(result)`**: Prints the result and copies it to the clipboard.
- **`find_possible_cheat_positions(initial_distance, cheat_time_limit)`**: Finds all possible valid cheat paths, considering the constraints of the cheat time limit.
- **`distances` Dictionary**: Stores the shortest distance from the end to each position, which is used to check if a cheat path saves time.

## Part Two Changes:
- In part two, the maximum cheat time was increased from 2 picoseconds to 20 picoseconds, allowing for more potential cheat paths. The code was adjusted to handle this increased cheat duration.

This approach uses BFS to calculate the shortest paths and explore all cheat paths, ensuring that all possible options are considered efficiently.

## My Favourite Days
### 1) [Day 14](/14) Anti LLM? Xmas Trees
You have to wonder if this question was made specifically for LLMs to struggle.
This was good fun, even though I had to trial and error my size of connected areas down to 150.
You can see my xmas tree [here](/14).

### 2) [Day 24](/24) Pen and Paper IDE
Part one was trivial, but I sat for a while trying to come up with an optimised way of solving the problem.

Eventually, using code to find the 8 incorrect paths and knowing we were creating adders: I found the gates by hand with :
- every OR gate needs to be connected to 2 AND gates
- every AND gate that was not connected to an input must to an OR gate

### 3) [Day 8](/8) Vectors
It was great to see and use some of the vectors knowledge from first year and a-levels.

### 4) [Day 11](/11) Dynamic Programming

First time (if I remember correctly) you couldn't brute force and it was nice to implement some dynamic programming (again first year)

### 5) [Day 13](/13) Number Theory
Implemented the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for solving Diophantine equations. 

We were solving for **integer solutions** to a linear equation, which was interesting initially, due to not knowing if there was a integer solution as there was small epsilons from floating point error.

### 6) [Day 23](/23) Graphs and Cliques 

Briefly encountered cliques in data and algos too. Was nice to implement the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm.

## Finishing Notes:

I didn't really challenge myself this year and just did it in python (which im comfortable with) and didn't go for speed (in running time or leaderboard). 

Next year I would like to learn Rust and compete in the [Codspeed](https://codspeed.io/advent?utm_source=aoc) Aoc challenge. I'll probably redo a previous year in Rust soon!
